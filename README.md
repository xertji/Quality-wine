 #Preprocessing of Dataset
 
 Creating categorical variables for Quality.
 
 Splitting the dataset into 'training set' and 'test set'.
 
# Modelling

Accuracy and  confusion matrix was found using different classifiers.

Random Forest - 87% accuracy

Stochastic Gradient Decent Classifier - 84% accuracy.

Support Vector Classifier - 86% accuracy.

SVC improves from 86% to 90%  after using Grid Search CV

Random forest accuracy increases from 87% to 91 % using cross validation score.
